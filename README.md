### Reflection:

Again, very challenging particularly when I initially decided I was going to use TS, then decided not too, then guilt-tripped myself into doing it again. Found it difficult to get going, the challenging part was linking Clerk and what I’m going to pull off it/what I can pull of it & how, combined with the DB usage/storage. A lot of moving parts and to top it off learning and using TS didn’t help (although I can only blame myself for that one).
Ultimately because I felt as though there was a lot of learning, back and forth about how I was going to do things, led to not being able to have time to implement as much as I wanted. Again, decided to sacrifice styling time for functional code learning time.
I was more determined to get the main functional elements working. Getting the profile pics up for each post was way harder than I had anticipated!
I certainly know more about TS than I did previously which is a bonus, however much more learning to go.
